# Animated-Finger-Spelling-System
Sign language is the major communication medium of the hearing
impaired and aurally impaired community. In general , a sign gesture
refers to a word or a phrase in a speech language and also known as
conversational sign. A fingerspelling sign is a special sign intended to
show a character at a time that matches a character in alphabet of a
given language. This enables the hearing impaired community to con-
vey words that do not have a conversational sign, such as a name of
person and places, using a character by character technique. For this
we have used Indic Natural Sign Language Processing Library which
in total 10 indic language.


This project aims to deal with creating an animated finger spelling
system for Indic Sign Language which will ultimately reduce the cost
of interpretation and make the sign language easy and interactive.It
also aims to include many major non indic language into phonetic En-
glish in order to be acceptable at all places and scenarios.


A 3D human model character created using Makehuman and Blender
based indic sign interpreter system is achieved by creating a phonetic
English-based 3D human animation system made with Blender and
Unity animation software.
